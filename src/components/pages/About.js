            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <body>
            BiGAUSTIN was founded in 1992 as a City of Austin-funded organization designed to help people start their own small business, particularly low to moderate income minorities. In 1995, BiGAUSTIN obtained its 501(c)(3) non-profit status and began independent operations.
            <br></br> <br></br>
            Today, BiGAUSTIN obtains its funding from the state of Texas, private equity firms, Travis County, local and national banks, and the federal government. We are proud of our partnerships and will continue to leverage them for the benefit of our clients. BiGAUSTIN is also governed by a fully independent Board of Directors.
